About Fin Fin

Do you often pay attention to spending habits? Actually, your money habits have a personality—and it’s probably a little wild. This quiz helps you discover your Financial Spirit Animal, so you can laugh at your spending style and learn how to improve it.

We will use different animals to represent your financial personality, because finance should be fun, not boring. And let’s be honest—picturing yourself as a budgeting squirrel or a splurging raccoon just makes sense.
