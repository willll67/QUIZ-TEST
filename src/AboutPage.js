        Do you often pay attention to spending habits? Actually, your money habits have a personalityâ€”and itâ€™s probably a little wild. This quiz helps you discover your Financial Spirit Animal, so you can laugh at your spending style and learn how to improve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use different animals to represent your financial personality, because finance should be fun, not boring. And letâ€™s be honestâ€”picturing yourself as a budgeting squirrel or a splurging raccoon just makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take the quiz and meet your money animal! ðŸ’¸
